This a repo created to submit a homework for my data science class.


The repo contains an .ipynb file which has the summary to the article the homework was about. 
It also contains a readme file that has the basic information of the repo, and has a gitignore file.


It also contains two branches, the main, and another one called 'feature-1' where the summary is.
